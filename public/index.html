<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Jason, a programmer and freelancer. I like making games, backend systems, and teaching people! Contact me if you&rsquo;re interested in hiring me or if you just want to chat about math and logic. I&rsquo;ve got a few things here so feel free to check those out too!</p>

<p>Guess Who? That&rsquo;s right, after my previous update, I dropped into a coma* for a year and just now decided to wake up long enough to make a small update to the site. I have added a credits/acknowledgement page for all the people I can think of who have taught me something of value! I would love to say that I&rsquo;ll be updating the website more frequently, but entering an unconscious stupor can be quite unpredictable, so you will just have to check back in a year or so to see if I remembered to update this. Till tomorrow&rsquo;s destiny everyone!</p>
<p>*Joking</p>
<h4 id="29th-may-2024-backend-work">29th-May-2024: Backend work</h4>
<p>In order to make it easier for me to produce things here, I&rsquo;ve completely overhauled the design process for these webpages. Hopefully this should make it easier for me to create more things on here!</p>
<p>PS: There&rsquo;s also been a new addition to the projects page, hope you like it!</p>
<h4 id="21th-oct-2023-file-handling-article">21th-Oct-2023: File handling article</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just released my first article! It&rsquo;s not very polished yet but I wanted to make sure I didn&rsquo;t procrastinate it anymore.</p>
<h4 id="11th-sep-2023-donations">11th-Sep-2023: Donations</h4>
<p>If you look over at the contact tab you can now see a couple donation options, I don&rsquo;t have many options there yet but I&rsquo;ll try to expand as soon as I can!</p>
<h4 id="5th-sep-2023-articles-tab">5th-Sep-2023: Articles tab</h4>
<p>I now have articles/blog posts set up!<br>
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make lessons in text for a while so (assuming I remember), you should be seeing some text-based tutorials in no time!</p>
