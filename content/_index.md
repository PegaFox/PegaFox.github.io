# About Me

Hello! I'm Jason, a programmer and freelancer. I like making games, backend systems, and teaching people! Contact me if you're interested in hiring me or if you just want to chat about math and logic. I've got a few things here so feel free to check those out too!

### Recent updates

#### 29th-July-2025: Well that was fast

Well would you look at that! I managed to add an update only... Hang on let me check...

Five days after the last one! I'm definitely rewarding myself for that! (Though I wouldn't count on another update any time soon) Anyway, I've added something to the projects tab and might be adding a few more in the near future. A large part of why I made this website is so I could have an easily customizable portfolio, so I want to fill out that page as much as I can!

I also hope to make more articles soon, I have a few in my head about graphical rendering techniques or maybe how computers work at the lowest level, but you will just have to wait and see if I ever decide to make them. Toodles!

#### 24th-July-2025: A return

Guess Who? That's right, after my previous update, I dropped into a coma* for a year and just now decided to wake up long enough to make a small update to the site. I have added a credits/acknowledgement page for all the people I can think of who have taught me something of value! I would love to say that I'll be updating the website more frequently, but entering an unconscious stupor can be quite unpredictable, so you will just have to check back in a year or so to see if I remembered to update this. Till tomorrow's destiny everyone!

#### 29th-May-2024: Backend work

In order to make it easier for me to produce things here, I've completely overhauled the design process for these webpages. Hopefully this should make it easier for me to create more things on here!

PS: There's also been a new addition to the projects page, hope you like it!

#### 21th-Oct-2023: File handling article

I've just released my first article! It's not very polished yet but I wanted to make sure I didn't procrastinate it anymore.

#### 11th-Sep-2023: Donations

If you look over at the contact tab you can now see a couple donation options, I don't have many options there yet but I'll try to expand as soon as I can!

#### 5th-Sep-2023: Articles tab

I now have articles/blog posts set up!  
I've been wanting to make lessons in text for a while so (assuming I remember), you should be seeing some text-based tutorials in no time!
